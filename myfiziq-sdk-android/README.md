# myfiziq-sdk-android
SDK for MyFiziq core functionality

Depends on:
```myfiziq-sdk-cpp```
```https://github.com/ahasbini/Android-OpenCV```

**NOTE: There is an issue with the GIT pull for Android-OpenCV due to LFS limitations - To work around this we need to add the OpenCV SDK files from ```https://opencv.org/releases.html``` (Android pack).
